negative emotions are a result of unmet expectations


ie. your cognitive model is incorrect, leads to incorrect predictions, when reality proves your predictions wrong, there is congnitive dissonance (between reality and your model), and you need to make a chance to your model (being wrong == having to correct your model == results in your brain sending negative reinforcement signals == you feel unhappy)
